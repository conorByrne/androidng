Thats a problem for businesses that see mobile devices and applications as a promising way to introduce new cost-effective services and build loyal, lasting customer relationships. The ability to integrate strong authentication into handheld devices so the process is invisible or under the hood to the end user is a big step to meeting the fears of mobile users. Traditional strong authentication has typically been expensive to implement and scale. Cloud-based strong authentication means zero footprint and cost saving benefits as it replaces the need for expensive traditional tokens. The convenience of integrating strong authentication into mobile devices enables businesses to build trust with their mobile users, without the need of costly and cumbersome methods. With integrated strong authentication, enterprises and financial institutions can not only simplify their users experience but also strengthen security through the method, making the mobile logon experience simpler, safer and more convenient to the user.
